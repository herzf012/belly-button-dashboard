# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard
## About
The purpose of this repository is to showcase a dashboard using belly button biodiversity data. This dashboard allows one to select a sample ID and it's information will be displayed as text, a bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge. This is done in **javascript** using the **D3 library** and **Plotly**.

Credit to instructor **Dominic LaBella** for the tutorial, help, and code on this assignment.
